// Description
// In a racing series, all drivers start from a perfectly ordered starting grid. After the race, you are given the moves describing how many positions each driver gained or lost relative to their starting position. A positive value means the driver moved forward (gained places), and a negative value means the driver dropped back (lost places).
//
// Task
// Your task is to determine whether this finishing order is valid, assuming that:
//
//     The starting grid is perfectly ordered:
//     No two drivers can start in the same position.
//     There are no gaps in positions in the starting grid.
//     No two drivers can finish in the same position.
//     Every driver finishes the race.
//     Write a function that:
//
//     Takes an array moves of length n, where moves[i] is the number of positions the driver that finished at position i gained (positive) or lost (negative) compared to their starting position.
//     Returns a boolean indicating whether there exists a valid race result consistent with the moves.
//     Constraints
// 2 <= n <= 100.
// Examples
// moves	Result	Explanation
//     [2, -1, -1]	True	The driver that started in last position overtook both drivers before him
//     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	True	The race finished in the same order as the starting grid
//     [-1, 1, -1]	False	The winner lost a position, which is invalid
//     [0, 1, 0]	False	The drivers that ended in second and third position both started last, which is invalid
// Good luck, have fun!

    const n = moves.length;

    for (let finishPos = 0; finishPos < n; finishPos++) {
        const startPos = finishPos + moves[finishPos];
        if (startPos < 0 || startPos >= n) return false;
        if (seen.has(startPos)) return false;
        seen.add(startPos);
